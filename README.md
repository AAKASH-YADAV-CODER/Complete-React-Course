# My Complete React Course

This branch of the repo contains final code for all sections and projects of the course


### Q1: What VSCode theme are you using?

**A:** I use Monokai Pro for all my coding and course production. It's a paid theme (I', **not** affiliated with them), but you can actually use the free demo version forever ðŸ˜…

**A:** Sure! Here you go:

- [Food-Order] (the "Food Order" project showcases the capabilities of React Hooks in building a responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly food ordering application.)
- [Single-Page-Application(SPA)]("Meetups Places" is a web application developed using React SPA Router, a powerful library for handling routing in single-page applications. This project aims to connect people with local meetups and help them discover interesting places to gather and socialize.)
- [Bankist Site] (Advanced DOM and Events)
- [Todo-App] (The "Todo App" is a web application developed using React and TypeScript, a powerful combination for building robust and type-safe user interfaces. This project aims to provide users with a convenient and organized way to manage their tasks and to-do lists.)
